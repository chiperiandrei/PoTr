High school, - cemetery
My youth -
Pedant teachers
And heavy exams ...
And today you are
High school, - cemetery
My youth!
High school, - cemetery
With long corridors -
Today is no longer me
And my mind hurts ...
Nothing I ever want -
High school, - cemetery
With long corridors ...
High school, - cemetery
My youth -
The world you gave me
In heavy rains,
So blasted ...
High school, - cemetery
My youth!	</text>
